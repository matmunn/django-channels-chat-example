# Django Channels Chat Example #

This example is based almost entirely 100% off the Django Channels documentation found at https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/, with the addition of chat nicknames as well.

## Starting the project ##

This project relies on Docker and docker-compose being available.

Clone this repository, open the directory and run:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

Once provisioned the example should be available at http://localhost:8000/chat.

## Contributing ##

If you think this example could be modified to better show the use of Django Channels then submit a PR and I'll happily merge it.
